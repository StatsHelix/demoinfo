# DemoInfo

This is a C#-Library that makes reading CS:GO-Demos and analyzing them easier. 

![Travis CI results](https://travis-ci.org/EHVAG/demoinfo.svg?branch=master)


## nuget-package
We now have an official nuget-package! See https://www.nuget.org/packages/DemoInfo/

### Stable releases

These are created and uploaded manually by us. The assemblies are properly signed (the *public* key is right here in the repo).

### Prereleases

Our nuget prereleases are created automatically by travis whenever the `master` branch is updated. Therefore, bugs and sudden API changes are more likely. In return, you always get the latest improvements as soon as we push them. The version strings look like this: `0.0.0-ci<unix timestamp when the package was built>-<git commit hash>`

Please note that the assemblies in these releases are **not** properly signed. They're [delay-signed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t07a3dye.aspx) to ensure seamless compatibility with regular (stable) releases, but they don't carry a valid signature. This means that you *may* have to exclude `DemoInfo.dll` from strong name verification if you use these prereleases (see also: [#39](https://github.com/moritzuehling/demoinfo-public/pull/39)).

### Debug symbols

Since no Windows machines are involved in any part of the development process, we can't provide `pdb` symbols for our releases. If you need to step into DemoInfo during debugging, you have to download the source code and add it to your project. Sorry.

## Usage
Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/moritzuehling/demostatistics-generator/blob/master/README.md#usage-of-demoinfo-public). There is also an example-project where you can see the parser in action!

[1] This is not networked for some odd reason. 

[2] This is actually pretty tricky since, for example the USP and the CZ are actually networked with the same class. We use some dark magic to find out what is the correct weapon.
